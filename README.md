# Runa's Strive
It is a round based rpg game in which the hero "runa" has to fight agains monster.

The game has for now 2 floors and each floor has 4 rooms. The last room is always the boss.

It is a terminal based game. 

It has only one command:
* quit (you can always enter it and it will quit the session)

every other required input is described when needed. If the input is wrong it will ask you to enter it again.
